    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf 
        had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in 
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's 
        grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when 
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known 
        an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf 
        decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that 
        stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also 
        believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes 
        prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious 
        Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as 
        Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a 
        fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince 
            Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain. Early 
            in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain 
            were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, 
            he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated 
            when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He 
            marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. 
            At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken 
            tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet 
            "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

            <p>Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of 
            their mother Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin 
            II, and great-grandsons of Thror. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was 
            his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves on the Quest of Erebor.

            <p>Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and 
            uncle of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. 
            Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, 
            and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim 
            the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.

            <h3>Gloin</h3>
            <p>In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, 
            the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. In TA 2941, Glóin and 
            his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among the 
            Dwarves accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely 
            Mountain to recapture The Kingdom of Erebor from the Dragon Smaug. He was 
            noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin, was 
            usually the one told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made camp. 
            Gloin also fought in the Battle of the Five Armies.[1] After the battle, 
            he returned to the Lonely Mountain.

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the 
            dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those 
            driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, 
            he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the 
            Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, 
            in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he 
            attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

            <p>Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin 
            was the son of Fundin and younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle 
            of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thrain the Second and Thorin 
            Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

            <p>Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. 
            In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with 
            Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other dwarves on the quest for the Lonely 
            Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other dwarves of 
            Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of the Five Armies, and he survived it.

            Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. 
            He and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the Dragon Smaug, and 
            were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II 
            Oakenshield to a new life in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

            hailed from the Blue Mountains. As such, they felt less strongly about the quest to reclaim the Lonely

            line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Moria. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere 
            between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years," 
            and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. 
            Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue 
            Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

            <h3>Gandalf</h3>
            <p>Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar (with the possible exception of Melian). 
            He was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur, and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur 
            who entered into Eä. In his "youth", he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo and Nienna named. 
            He was associated with light and fire, much like his peer Varda.[3] Yet his ways often took him to Nienna, 
            from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but he walked unseen among them, or wore a fana that 
            appeared like an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his existence, 
            he followed the example of Nienna, he took pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drove those who 
            listened to him out of despair.
